# IYS INTERNET 2006

**Unofficial speculative digital concept. Not affiliated with In Your Shoe.**
Design & development concept by **Omar Akram, 2026**. No orders can be placed.
Product names, logo and photography belong to their respective rights holders
and are used here for a non-commercial portfolio concept.

> **What if today’s In Your Shoe travelled back to the internet of 2006?**

In Your Shoe did not exist in 2006, and nothing here pretends it did. This is the
**current** brand — its full public catalogue, current FW27 campaign, stores and
official language — loaded into an original, functioning computer from the
mid-2000s. The website *is* the computer; the store runs inside it.

**The visual language is 2006. The engineering is 2026. The brand is current IYS.**

---

## Revision — IYS team feedback (2026-09)

1. **Mobile more retro + blue/green screen vibe.** IYS MOBILE now sits on
   *IYS Hills* (`public/iys/os/hills.svg`), an original vector sky + rolling
   green hills in the cheerful mid-2000s screen mood — no Microsoft/Windows
   asset, name or logo. Glossy sky-blue chrome, grass-green accents, light
   rounded panels.
2. **Less distraction, more CTA.** The 3×3 icon grid and big clock are gone.
   One hero window carries the official line plus **Shop the drop** (green,
   primary → IYS’s Newest collection) and **Explore pjoys xo** (blue,
   secondary), both above the fold. Camera and Messages moved into MENU.
   Product pages show title, price and sizes above the fold; the green centre
   soft key is always the next step (SHOP → PICK SIZE → ADD 2 BAG → CHECKOUT).
3. **Y2K voice.** Concept microcopy uses 2000s slang sparingly (“omg new drop
   just landed :)”, “u + this fit = meant 2 b xx”, “subscribe 2 our newsletter
   xoxo”, “ur bag is empty :(”, “IYS was here XD”). It lives in
   `concept.y2k` in `src/data/copy.ts`, kept apart from verified official IYS
   lines; honesty notes (snapshot prices, no real orders) are kept.
4. **Desktop keeps its OS**, gains the same CTA pair above the FW27 hero, a
   green ADD 2 BAG / CHECKOUT, the Y2K copy and an *IYS Hills* wallpaper preset.

## Design thesis

- **Build a computer, not a skin.** IYS OS is a real window manager (drag,
  resize, minimise, maximise, focus/z-order, taskbar), with a browser, a
  messenger, a camera, a file explorer, a bag and a control panel.
- **Old interface, new clothes.** Period chrome (glossy title bars, bevels,
  8.3 filenames, status bars, 88×31 badges, one marquee) frames real, current,
  colour-accurate product photography.
- **The brand is the subject.** Identity comes from real products (Pjoys,
  Cairo, Cereal Killer, Touch Grass), real categories and counts, the current
  campaign, the stores and the official lines — not just the logo.
- **2026 UX underneath.** Single-click everything, big touch targets on
  mobile, real form controls, keyboard support, reduced motion, sound off by
  default, no fake loading delays.

A happy discovery during research: IYS’s **current FW27 campaign is staged
with CRT TVs and old computers**. Those real photos are the default wallpaper —
shown as current campaign imagery inside a fictional 2006 machine, never as
archive photos.

## What’s inside

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Boot** | ~2 s CRT power-on → POST lines → the current IYS wordmark → “TIME TARGET: 2006”. SKIP button, Esc/Enter, once per session, 250 ms fade with reduced motion. |
| **IYS.EXE** | “You’re about to make a Cool Decision!” (official line) with *Cancel* / *Obviously* (concept UI). |
| **Desktop** | Original SVG icon family, FW27 wallpaper, taskbar with IYS menu, quick launch, window buttons, messenger/connection/sound tray and the real device clock (tooltip: “TIME MACHINE TARGET: 2006”). |
| **IYS INTERNET** | Browser with Back/Forward (real history), Refresh, Home, Search, Favorites, Bag, a fake `http://www.inyourshoe.com/...` address that mirrors the real route, a Links bar and a status bar. “View on real IYS site ↗” is the only way out. |
| **Home portal** | Official lines and dated announcements, FW27 hero, **TOP 8 COOL DECISIONS**, NEW STUFF (IYS’s own Newest collection), Pjoys, `C:\IYS\CAIRO\` (القاهرة), IYS × ZED, currently-online buddies, stores, IYS MAIL, a *fictional* TIME TRAVELLERS counter, an honest empty guestbook, original badges. |
| **Shop** | Every public product, 48 per page, « Previous 1 2 3 … N Next », sort, Control-Panel filters (type, size, price, availability, sale), URL-synced state. |
| **Search** | Fuse.js over title/type/collections/tags, typo-tolerant (“ceral” → Cereal Killer). |
| **Product** | IYS IMAGE VIEWER + PRODUCT PROPERTIES: all photos, zoom, full-size viewer, real options and per-variant availability (no silent default size), sale only when a real compare-at exists, description, VIEW CURRENT ITEM ON IYS ↗. |
| **Bag** | “COPYING ITEM TO: MY BAG” < 1 s, quantities, remove, subtotal in EGP, CONCEPT CHECKOUT (“No order will be placed.”). |
| **Favorites** | ★ ADD TO FAVORITES, a browser-favorites page, persisted locally. |
| **IYS MESSENGER** | Collections as buddies. **2:13 AM — PJOYS is online: “u awake?” / “enta sa7y?”**, then real Pjoys arrive as file transfers, plus pattern tiles you can set as wallpaper. Scripted concept copy; no bot, no fake customers. |
| **IYS CAMERA** | `E:\DCIM\` — CAMPAIGNS, PJOYS, CAIRO, STORES; 4:3 contact sheet, image viewer, set as wallpaper. |
| **MY WARDROBE** | Explorer over IYS’s own taxonomy; every count comes from data; decorative filenames beside official titles. |
| **Stores** | FIND IYS IRL — every published store with address line, hours, phone, directions. |
| **Control Panel** | Wallpaper (presets, stretch/center/tile), sound, CRT filter, Time Machine (2006 only), System (snapshot facts), About, Reset desktop. |
| **Easter eggs** | README.TXT, RECYCLE BIN (BORING_OUTFITS, empty), `TOUCH_GRASS.EXE` (“ERROR: TOUCH GRASS NOT FOUND.” → the real product), `GAME_NIGHT.EXE`, a screensaver after 60 s idle. |
| **IYS MOBILE** | A separate shell below 700 px on an original sky-and-hills screen: glossy status strip, path titles, a `welcome.htm` hero with **Shop the drop** (primary) + **Explore pjoys xo** (secondary), four shortcuts, a “just dropped” strip, a newsletter panel, list screens, swipe gallery, glossy soft keys (BACK · green context key · BAG), same catalogue/bag/favorites/routes. |

## Full public catalogue (Egyptian storefront = authority)

The concept contains **every product publicly published on the Egyptian
storefront** at snapshot time — not a curated cast. Counts are never typed by
hand; they are generated into `src/data/catalogue-meta.json`:

| metric (snapshot 2026-09-29) | value |
| --- | --- |
| `publicProductsTotal` | 1,249 |
| `allProductsCollectionCount` (IYS’s own All Products) | 1,224 |
| `productsOutsideAllProducts` | 25 — public collaboration capsules (IYS × ZED, Silver Sands) |
| `variantsTotal` | 4,843 |
| currency / market | EGP / Egypt |

`/shop` (“Shop All”) lists all 1,249 public products and explains the
difference; `/collections/all-products` shows IYS’s own 1,224-item collection
in IYS’s own order. Search covers all 1,249.

**Why Egypt:** the same Shopify store serves Saudi/UAE/Kuwait/UK/international
markets with converted prices and slightly different assortments. The sync uses
only unprefixed Egyptian URLs, sends the store’s own `localization=EG` cookies,
aborts unless the homepage reports `Shopify.currency.active = "EGP"`, rejects
any international-market URL, and cross-checks prices against the product Ajax
endpoint.

### `npm run sync-products`

Manual, never automatic (not on install, not on dev, no bot commits).
Discovery fallback chain, all public and sequential (~4.5 s apart, 429/5xx
retried with Retry-After/backoff):

1. `sitemap.xml` → Egyptian product sitemaps (+ homepage navigation for collections)
2. `/products.json?limit=250&page=N` (paged until empty)
3. `/collections/<handle>/products.json` → membership and IYS’s own order
4. `/products/<handle>.js` for anything still missing
5. JSON-LD in the product page
6. otherwise reported (sitemap entries that 404 are reported as *not public*)

It normalises (never fabricates — unknown = `null`), prints a validation report
(discovered/normalised/unique/duplicates, images, prices, compare-at, variants,
collections, product types, invalid URLs, unparseable, currency mismatches,
international contamination), **fails loudly** on integrity problems or a >20%
shrink, then writes deterministic output and regenerates the catalogue section
of `docs/SOURCES.md`. Raw responses are cached in `.cache/sync/` (gitignored);
`--offline` rebuilds from that cache. `npm run sync-stores` refreshes the store
directory the same way.

### Catalogue architecture (measured)

| file | raw | gzip | loaded |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/data/catalogue-index.json` (compact card/filter/search fields) | 589 KB | 114 KB | as its own chunk, in parallel with the boot — never blocks it |
| `public/catalogue/p-XX.json` × 32 (descriptions, all images, all variants) | 3.0 MB total | 434 KB total | one ~14 KB shard when a product opens |

One flat file would have been ~3.6 MB raw on first load, so the split is
justified by measurement.

### Snapshot notice

Prices, sale states and availability are **as of the sync timestamp** (shown in
the status bar, product pages and Control Panel → System). This is not live
commerce; every product links to the current item on inyourshoe.com.

## Images (hybrid)

- **Full catalogue:** official Shopify CDN URLs, lazy, `decoding="async"`,
  responsive `srcset` using the CDN `width` parameter. If a remote image
  disappears the UI shows “IMAGE COULD NOT LOAD” with the real title (and
  Retry / View original where appropriate) — never a substitute photo.
- **Curated local assets:** `npm run fetch-showcase-assets` downloads only the
  127 images the experience and the film need (logos, FW27 + ZED campaign,
  10 store photos, curated products, camera frames, pattern tiles, 48 showcase
  thumbnails) → Sharp → sRGB WebP (q 78–86), never upscaled, no colour grading
  (~8.4 MB). Every file is logged in `docs/SOURCES.md` with its official URL.
  Digital-camera effects are CSS on campaign/lifestyle frames only.

## Routes

`/` · `/shop` · `/collections/:handle` · `/search?q=` · `/product/:handle`
(`/products/:handle` redirects) · `/favorites` · `/stores` · `/showcase`.
Query state (`page`, `sort`, `type`, `size`, `min`, `max`, `stock`, `sale`, `q`)
survives refresh. Deep links skip the boot and open IYS INTERNET on the exact
product. Closing the browser window returns the address to `/`.

## State & persistence

Zustand stores: `useOS` (windows, focus, dialogs — **never persisted**, so a
broken layout can’t be saved), `useCart` + `useFavorites` + `usePreferences`
(sound, CRT, wallpaper → `localStorage`), `useSession` (boot / welcome / PJOYS
ping → `sessionStorage`).

## Desktop vs mobile

Below 700 px the app renders **IYS MOBILE**, a different shell (not a shrunken
desktop). Both shells share catalogue, query/search logic, product/variant
logic, cart, favorites and routes. The mobile chunk never downloads the window
manager (react-rnd) or GSAP. Tablets get the desktop shell with the browser,
wardrobe and camera opening maximised.

## Performance (measured on the production build)

| chunk | gzip | when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| entry (`index-*.js`: React, router, stores, shared UI) | 81.6 KB | always |
| `DesktopShell` + `gsap` + shared app chunk | 19.3 + 26.2 + 9.7 KB | desktop only |
| `MobileShell` | 7.0 KB | mobile only (no react-rnd, no GSAP) |
| `catalogue-index` (all 1,249 products) | 110 KB | in parallel with boot |
| `search` (Fuse.js) | 9.3 KB | first search |
| `Showcase` | 7.4 KB | `/showcase` only |
| one catalogue detail shard | ~14 KB | when a product opens |

Initial JS ≈ 137 KB gz on desktop and ≈ 98 KB on mobile (well under the
400 KB budget); every app window and browser page is a lazy chunk. The shop
never renders more than 48 cards; remote photos are lazy, `decoding="async"`,
and sized through the CDN `width` parameter. No Lighthouse score is claimed
here — none was measured.

## Accessibility

Real buttons/inputs/selects/checkboxes/radios; windows are labelled non-modal
dialogs; system dialogs are modal `alertdialog`s with focus trap and focus
return; Escape closes windows/dialogs/menus; keyboard menus and tabs; context
menu via right-click, Shift+F10 or the menu key; visible dotted focus; skip
link; `prefers-reduced-motion` removes boot animation, flicker, marquee, blink,
window animation and camera flash; sound off by default; 44 px mobile targets.
Automated: axe (WCAG 2.1 A/AA, serious + critical) on the desktop portal, shop,
product, bag/messenger/control-panel windows — 0 violations. This is tested
behaviour, not a certification.

## Testing

```bash
npm test          # Vitest — 58 tests: normalisation, EGP parsing, tags, JSON-LD,
                  # validation, shard hash, stores parser, filters, sort, pagination,
                  # facets, cart, variants, AND the committed snapshot (every product
                  # exactly once across all pages, metrics consistent, curated handles
                  # resolve, search: ceral/cairo/pjoys/hoodie/socks/kids/jeans/black)
npm run test:e2e  # Playwright (builds + previews): 32 tests — boot/skip, window
                  # manager, drag bounds, menu, clock, messenger, touch grass, camera,
                  # wallpaper persistence, wardrobe counts, control panel, shop +
                  # pagination, filters/sort/reset, sale, fuzzy search, deep links
                  # (first/middle/last/kids/women/collab), bag quantities, checkout,
                  # favorites, stores, 404, back/forward, image fallback, 1024 smoke,
                  # mobile shell/shop/product/bag/search/targets, axe
npm run qa:screens  # canonical screenshots → docs/qa/
```

E2E blocks the remote CDN, so tests never depend on IYS being reachable.

## Showcase film — `/showcase`

A deterministic 1080×1920 portrait film (**19.2 s**) built from the site’s own
styles and markup, driven by one paused GSAP master timeline:
boot → FW27 desktop → IYS.EXE → portal + TOP 8 → 2:13 AM PJOYS (“u awake?”, real
Pjoys arrive) → the whole catalogue pages by → search CAIRO → *Cairo Is A
Mindset* hoodie, size M, ADD TO BAG → IYS CAMERA → set the Cereal Killer
balcony photo as wallpaper → MY WARDROBE counts → controlled desktop chaos →
everything minimises → IYS.EXE → end card → power-off.

- `/showcase?t=5.2` seeks and pauses.
- `window.__iysShowcase` = `{ play, pause, seek(t), restart, time(), duration, ready }`.
- Every image is local; the renderer blocks all external requests.

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview   # in one terminal
npm run frames                     # QA stills → out/frames/*.png
npm run record                     # → out/iys-internet-2006.mp4 (H.264, 1080×1920, 60 fps)
```

`record` seeks the timeline frame by frame with Playwright (540×960 CSS px at
device scale 2) and pipes PNGs into FFmpeg. The MP4 lives in `out/`
(gitignored) and is never committed.

## PWA

`vite-plugin-pwa` (auto-update, `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim`, outdated caches
cleaned). Precached: the app shell, JS/CSS, logos, cursors, icons and the two
wallpaper photos. Runtime-cached: catalogue shards (network-first) and local
curated images. **Not cached:** the 1,000+ remote CDN product photos. Offline,
the OS still opens, shows “INTERNET CONNECTION LOST”, and keeps showing
snapshot prices labelled as a snapshot. The installed app is named
“IYS Internet 2006 — Concept”. `sw.js` is served `no-cache`, so new
deployments are picked up on the next visit.

## Analytics

Standard Vercel Web Analytics (`@vercel/analytics`), page views only, no custom
events, no fingerprinting, loaded only in production builds and not on
`localhost`. It is never shown in the UI (the TIME TRAVELLERS counter is
fictional).

## Deploy (Vercel)

Repository `omarrakram/Concepts` · Branch `main` · Root Directory `IYS-2006` ·
Framework Vite · Install `npm ci` · Build `npm run build` · Output `dist`.
The original Cool Decision Club concept lives separately in `IYS/`.
`vercel.json` rewrites every route to `index.html` (static files first), caches
hashed assets immutably, serves `sw.js` and catalogue shards with revalidation,
and sets `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` (plus `robots.txt`) so this unofficial concept
never competes with inyourshoe.com in search. The normal build needs no network and no secrets.

## Scripts

| command | does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | type-check + production build |
| `npm run preview` | serve `dist/` |
| `npm test` / `npm run test:e2e` | Vitest / Playwright + axe |
| `npm run sync-products` | re-snapshot the public Egyptian catalogue (network) |
| `npm run sync-stores` | re-read the public store directory (network) |
| `npm run fetch-showcase-assets` | download + optimise the curated local images (network) |
| `npm run frames` / `npm run record` | showcase stills / MP4 |
| `npm run qa:screens` | canonical QA screenshots |
| `npm run poster` | 1080×1350 social poster (`out/`) + OpenGraph image (`public/og-poster.jpg`) |
| `node scripts/make-icons.mjs` | regenerate the original PWA icons from `public/favicon.svg` |

## Sources

See [`docs/SOURCES.md`](docs/SOURCES.md) (every page, endpoint and local asset
with its official URL) and [`docs/RESEARCH.md`](docs/RESEARCH.md) (brand and
2004–2007 interface research, Egypt context, design decisions).

## Known limitations

- Snapshot data: prices, sales and stock can change after the sync date.
- Remote product photos depend on the official CDN; offline they show an honest
  placeholder box, not a substitute image.
- Tahoma/Verdana are used when installed; elsewhere the stack falls back to
  DejaVu/Arial (no fonts are bundled).
- The fake address bar accepts `inyourshoe.com` paths and search terms; it never
  navigates away from the concept.
- Messenger conversations are fixed concept scripts (by design, no AI).
- The official “Same-day delivery” / “Free Shipping +2,499” / 10% lines are
  promotional and dated; re-verify before each publish.
